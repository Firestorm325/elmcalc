# ELMCalc
This is a calculator written using the EFL libraries. It will be a fully featured calculator utility once completed.

In it's current iteration this is somewhat of a quick-and-dirty script. I intend to improve its quality for ease of management and improved speed and appreciate any help you can offer.

# To Do
Tasks are now located in [this Project board](https://github.com/Firestorm325/elmcalc/projects/3).
